# Timezone Bot

A simple Discord bot that displays multiple time zones in its status, updating every minute.

## Using Render Free Tier To Keep App Running
* Render free plan can’t run Background Workers 24/7
* We run the bot as a Web Service with an HTTP health check endpoint
* A **GitHub Actions workflow** pings this endpoint every ~10 minutes so Render doesn’t put it to sleep
